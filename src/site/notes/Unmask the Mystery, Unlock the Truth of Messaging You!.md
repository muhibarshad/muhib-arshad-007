# Unmask the Mystery
## Unlock the Truth of Messaging You!

One day, while I was studying, I overheard some boys speaking disrespectfully about you. I won't mention their names, except for one individual, ***Ali Arslan***, as his behavior was particularly unacceptable. It became apparent to me that you were a good girl who was unaware of their intentions, and I feared that society would influence you negatively. It was on that day that I made the decision to reach out to you and warn you about them, urging you to be cautious.

In that moment, I was filled with fear and uncertainty. I didn't know how you would react or if you would even reply to my message. Various thoughts raced through my mind, including the possibility of being misunderstood or judged. Nevertheless, with trembling hands, I mustered the courage to send you that message. I also send same message to ***Sania***, knowing that both of you lived in the same hostel and shared the same bus stop, hoping that you could help me, even though I didn't actually require any assistance.

Just as I had opened our chat and contemplated how to approach the topic, a notification appeared on my screen. In my anxious state, by accidentally clicked on the video button, causing panic to well up within me. I held my breath as my mobile hung in mid-air, unsure of what to do next. Eventually, the video call ended abruptly, bringing a sense of relief. I assumed you were offline and hadn't noticed the mishap. However, to my surprise, you replied immediately. I struggled to find the right words to explain myself, apologizing and emphasizing that it was an accident and not intentional.

On every day I think, to message you about this, but leave this everyday, because on one side I really like you, and don't want to tell it you, and on the next side I want to tell you about this , and also tell about to be aware from others. But the fear of your thoughts, intention and everyday makes me to not do this. By the way I decided, I will talk little with you , revolve only around the topics and don't move away from the study topic. In my whole time there is no any hour I didn't thought about you.

One thing I've noticed is that you always seem unhappy in class. I think you might be facing some trouble that's affecting your mood. I wanted to let you know that you don't have to be obsessed with anything. Recently, I've been making an effort to come to university regularly, showing you that I also have an interest in studies (laughing emoji). Actually, I wish I could meet you in person and discuss all of this face to face, but I haven't found the time, and I also wonder what you think, still i didn't tell you about this because I think may you consider wrong me as I am also as them.
