# Myself and My POV

In this important part of our discussion, I will share my thoughts, point of view, and aspects of my personality. It is crucial for you to understand me better and form a positive judgment. Please note that I am not boasting or seeking to impress you; rather, I am simply showing you the real me, including both my good and bad habits.

First and foremost, I deeply love Allah Almighty. My journey with practicing the deen (religion) began in the 3rd grade and has continued ever since. Although there have been periods where I may have wavered or struggled, my core connection to Allah has always remained strong. If I were to detail the sacrifices I have made, it would require a separate discussion, as these sacrifices were made for myself, not for Allah. After all, Allah does not need us; we need Him.

I am not a narrow-minded or extremist individual. Rather, I consider myself a happy and straightforward follower of the deen. I do not involve myself in controversial aspects or engage in any actions that would cause harm to others.

Anything that brings shame in the eyes of Allah, I have abandoned. Despite having feelings for girls within my family, I have chosen to prioritize my relationship with Allah Almighty over any worldly desires.

I used to enjoy watching series and dramas, but I have chosen to give them up. While some may argue that certain series are permissible (halal), I have found that some concepts portrayed in these shows strongly contradict Islamic teachings.

However, I have watched a few good series that do not contain such objectionable concepts, such as "Gonul Dagi," "Mehmetcik Kutlu Amare," and "Stranger Things."

In the past, I enjoyed listening to songs, as some of them are truly beautiful. During a period of personal struggle, I constantly listened to songs for about six months to distract myself from the trauma. However, I realized that it only further disturbed my inner peace without providing any healing.

As a means of finding happiness and spreading joy, I turned to creating and sharing memes. But this not makes me happy, instead of making me to wast time to gather templates.

So in short you take it as , I will leave everyone but I will never leave Allah Almighty for any cost , even if my clothes are burned or I go o footpath. 

If I were to briefly explain myself, I am a man who is very sensitive internally. I can empathize with others and feel their emotions as if they were my own. Whenever I walk down the street and see someone, I always wonder how I can help them. For example, if I see a hawker, I wonder if they have earned enough for the day and if their children will have food in the evening. Sometimes, I even dedicate a portion of my income, around 20-40%, to charitable causes, and I have witnessed Allah's blessings and increased provision as a result.

I am a caring person. When I encounter someone going through hardships, especially in terms of mental health issues like anxiety, depression, or heartbreak, I approach them with the intention of offering support. I let them know that they are not alone, that I am there to listen and guide them through their struggles.

I am also very friendly. Even if my friends tease or make jokes about me, I never show that I am offended. Throughout my life, I cannot recall anyone coming to me and apologizing for breaking our friendship. It is always me who takes the first step, even if the fault lies with the other person. I apologize to them and strive to restore harmony and maintain good relations.

I have never shared these aspects of myself with anyone before, but I am sharing them with you to convey that I am not a negative person.

The last thing I want to emphasize is that I am not a materialistic person. I don't judge others solely based on their beauty, intelligence, wealth, or fame. Instead, I assess individuals based on the goodness of their hearts, their sense of humor, and their adherence to Islamic values. I am fully aware that material possessions and external attributes fade away with time, but the qualities I mentioned earlier endure, even in the face of death. Therefore, I will not judge you based on your appearance, family background, or financial status. If you possess these things, I consider them blessings, but if you don't, it doesn't matter to me. What truly matters to me is the value of a person, not their possessions. I give importance to others' thoughts, qualities, personality, and the essence of who they are as individuals. So, please understand that I will not judge you based on superficial aspects like clothing or a luxurious lifestyle. In my heart, I always hold respect for others. 

I have a fantastic sense of humor and enjoy engaging in playful activities. I find joy in doing childish things, playing physical and remote games, and even participating in silly antics that bring laughter to others. Exploring vast fields and immersing myself in nature is something I deeply appreciate. I also have a strong desire to travel the world with my partner, experiencing different cultures and creating unforgettable memories. My good sense of humor adds positivity and light-heartedness to my interactions with others, making moments more enjoyable and fostering a sense of connection.

Now, if I were to mention my bad habits, I must admit that I lack consistency in various aspects of life. For example, I may study diligently for two weeks and then take a two-week break. I have a tendency to alternate between intense periods of productivity and days where I simply sleep all day. When I asked my siblings about this, they referred to me as idle. Additionally, I struggle with impatience. I prefer to rush through tasks and have little tolerance for waiting. I am also not good in sports " Phly bol pa out".

One major problem in my life is that I tend to trust people too quickly. I believe that others will never betray my trust, leading me to share my deepest secrets with them. Unfortunately, I often realize later that this was a mistake.

I have some personal challenges, including overthinking, emotional attachments, living in a virtual world, and creating imaginary scenarios before sleep. These factors contribute to sleep problems. Furthermore, my confidence level is quite low, and I struggle with assertiveness. I don't know how to stand up for myself without hurting others.

I also feel uncomfortable in social gatherings, and the fear of being judged by society often hinders me. I am actively working on overcoming these issues, particularly by addressing my tendency to overthink and focusing on building my self-confidence.

When it comes to my secrets, I am a very intimistic person. I desire to love someone more than I love myself. One of my biggest fantasies is to sit together with my beloved on a bench, without the need for words, simply enjoying each other's presence and the beauty of nature. Holding hands and appreciating the world around us would be enough. I long to care for my beloved and do things that bring them happiness.

When it comes to my thoughts about a partner, I desire a girl who will stand by my side through thick and thin. I envision a relationship where she supports me, even during challenging times. If I were to face difficulties in the future and find myself unable to fulfill some of her wishes for a period of time, I hope she will not abandon me or make it a source of torment. Instead, I want her to understand the situation and offer me sympathy and support as we navigate through those challenges together.

From my family's side, I have two siblings. My sister is employed in a government city school, and my brother is currently pursuing his FSC (intermediate level of education). My father works as a Line Superintendent in MEPCO (Multan Electric Power Company), while my mother engages in embroidery work known as Gotta Kinari at home.

In terms of extended family, our relatives are limited. I have only one paternal uncle (chachu) and one paternal aunt (kahla). We do not have any maternal uncles, aunts, paternal or maternal grandparents. My chachu works as a clerk in Quaid-e-Azam University in Islamabad, and my khala is a housewife residing in Multan.

I reside in Kabirwala, a small city near Khanewal. In my opinion, my city is the best I have ever seen because it offers everything I need.

Since my childhood, my parents have experienced conflicts, which led them to live separately. We have accepted this situation as it is and continued to respect and support them. While they have always been cautious and caring towards us, they did not provide the level of affection we desired during our childhood.

In terms of financial conditions, I come from a middle-class family. We may not belong to the elite or be exceptionally wealthy, but we have all the necessary things in life. We have extra houses, some agricultural land, plots of land, and a good home where I currently reside. We have access to good clothing and quality food. Overall, our financial situation is comfortable within the middle-class spectrum.

This is sufficient, I believe. At this point, you have gained an understanding of who I am. Discussing my past and how I lived my earlier life would require another chapter. Perhaps we can explore it another day, covering topics such as self-development, childhood experiences, influential individuals, and hobbies. However, I don't consider this information vital. What truly matters is conveying my current situation and presenting my authentic self to you.I have written a short brief not on my past you can checkout it here [[Why people called me 007?\|Why people called me 007?]].
