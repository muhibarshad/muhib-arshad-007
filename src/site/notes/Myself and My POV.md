# Islamic POV

In this important part of our discussion, I will share my thoughts, point of view, and aspects of my personality. It is crucial for you to understand me better and form a positive judgment. Please note that I am not boasting or seeking to impress you; rather, I am simply showing you the real me, including both my good and bad habits.

First and foremost, ***I deeply love Allah Almighty***. My journey with practicing the deen (religion) began in the 3rd grade and has continued ever since. Although there have been periods where I may have wavered or struggled, my core connection to Allah has always remained strong. If I were to detail the sacrifices I have made, it would require a separate discussion, as these sacrifices were made for myself, not for Allah. After all, Allah does not need us; we need Him.

***I am not a narrow-minded or extremist individual***. Rather, I consider myself a happy and straightforward follower of the deen. I do not involve myself in controversial aspects or engage in any actions that would cause harm to others.

**Anything that brings shame in the eyes of Allah, I have abandoned. Despite having feelings for girls within my family, I have chosen to prioritize my relationship with Allah Almighty over any worldly desires.**

I used to enjoy watching series and dramas, but I have chosen to give them up. While some may argue that certain series are permissible (halal), I have found that some concepts portrayed in these shows strongly contradict Islamic teachings.

However, I have watched a few good series that do not contain such objectionable concepts, such as *"Gonul Dagi," "Mehmetcik Kutlu Amare," and "Stranger Things. "Money Heist"*

In the past, I enjoyed listening to songs, as some of them are truly beautiful. During a period of personal struggle, I constantly listened to songs for about six months to distract myself from the trauma. However, I realized that it only further disturbed my inner peace without providing any healing.

As a means of finding happiness and spreading joy, I turned to creating and sharing memes. But this not makes me happy, instead of making me to wast time to gather templates.

So in short you take it as , I will leave everyone but I will never leave Allah Almighty for any cost , even if my clothes are burned or I go o footpath.
