# Awakening the Senses
## How a Single Moment Realized and Opened My Eyes!

Then I came up with an ideaâ€”I thought maybe we could learn together on Google Meet, where I could listen to your voice. I made a complete study plan and hoped that you would accept it. I genuinely wanted to help you with your learning, particularly in web development and Git, as I believe they are essential skills.

>***Suddenly, I began noticing that you were ignoring me from the beginning,***

But I didn't pay much attention to it (feeling hurt). I observed that whenever I messaged you, you would reply very late, often with just one or two words. This confusion turned into harsh a reality when I messaged you and you didn't even reply to my greeting for the entire day. So I would message you again to remind you to reply. Maybe you were busy, but taking 10-20 seconds to respond wouldn't disrupt your life significantly. Then you mentioned that you weren't interested in my study plan, to which I replied, ***"It's okay."*** However, the truth is, I am currently going through a tough time, and I was hoping for someone who would support me and help me rebuild. I thought you might be that person, someone with whom I could learn consistently. But when you rejected my offer, it hurt me deeply, and I still haven't learned a single word. *Insha'Allah, I will overcome my situation and start everything anew*.

*One day, I shared 5-6 memes about the thread,* and you only saw the first one without acknowledging the others. It clearly indicated that you ignored me, just as you would see other people's statuses but move on when mine appeared. Furthermore, whenever I messaged you, you would ignore me to a great extent.

Then I start realizing that you are irritating from me, and you actually don't want to talk with me. Then I accept this harsh reality, And decided not to message you again , because it is as you wish. But on everyday I think a lot about you more than before and one day I think I have to get your hobbies as well, so I messaged you about the laptop scheme and then you also ignore me, then by sacrificing my self-respect, I message you and talk with you by accepting the fact that in actually you are not interested in me .
