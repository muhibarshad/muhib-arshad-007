# Partner POV

When it comes to my secrets, I am a very **intimistic person**. I desire to love someone more than I love myself. One of my **biggest fantasies** is to sit together with my beloved on a bench, without the need for words, simply enjoying each other's presence and the beauty of nature. Holding hands and appreciating the world around us would be enough. I long to care for my beloved and do things that bring them happiness.

When it comes to my thoughts about a partner, I desire a girl who will stand by my side through thick and thin. I envision a relationship where she supports me, even during challenging times. If I were to face difficulties in the future and find myself unable to fulfill some of her wishes for a period of time, I hope she will not abandon me or make it a source of torment. Instead, I want her to understand the situation and offer me sympathy and support as we navigate through those challenges together.
