# Beyond the Threshold
## What Drove Me to Initiate and Delve into These Depths with You?

*On that day, I reflected on our interactions from the beginning, and I realized that you never initiated conversations with me. Despite sacrificing my self-respect and messaging you first, you consistently ignored my messages. Sometimes, it would take an entire day for you to reply to a single message, while other times you would ignore one message and respond to another later. It was during this time that I recalled a particular status of yours that still lingers in my mind.*

I couldn't comprehend why you were behaving this way, as I didn't fully understand the thought processes of girls. Therefore, I decided to discuss this issue with my sister, who has a brilliant mind and tends to contemplate things more deeply than I do. 

She told me, 

>***Muhib, actually, all girls are similar to her. Initially, they may listen to you, but once they realize they have over-shared or revealed too much, they will start ignoring you. They are not interested in continuing the conversation or engaging further, so you don't text her again and don't disturb her, because she will never tell you about this she is irritating from you.***

But I am not satisfied with her response. I discussed the same issue with a friend of mine who has been teaching me ***all my Islamic teachings for the past 10 years***. He provided a different perspective, saying, 
>*Whenever a girl already has someone in her life, they may not feel comfortable talking to other people.*

After considering both responses, I realized that these viewpoints are not necessarily negative but rather reflect individual rights, priorities, and perspectives. It's important for me to respect other people's points of view, their priorities, and what they think. I have never compelled or forced anyone to do something against their will, and I will continue to maintain that approach. I will never said to you why you do this, why you are doing , because I have always respect for you. 

After these discussions and gaining different perspectives, I found myself unconsciously thinking about you more than before. I constantly wondered why you were behaving in the way you were and engaging in these actions. It left me with a sense of confusion. I questioned what you truly thought about me, whether you were interested in me like I was interested in you, and if you desired to continue our connection or not.

You don't know how much these thoughts have affected my sleep at night. I find myself unable to rest, constantly feeling like something is missing in my life. I can't help but think about you all the time, even though I don't understand why. In my eyes, you are the perfect girl I have ever come across. ***You possess intelligence, purity, faithfulness, goodness, strength, and the ability to understand things. You are also sensitive, crazy, and funny, just like me. You seem to embody everything I could ever desire in a person.***

However, I find myself torn between your peculiar behavior and the way you captivate my heart and mind. It feels as though I'm trapped in between, neither fully on stable ground nor fully immersed in uncertain waters. There is a series I watched called "**The End of the F___ing World**," where the girl have same hair style, and looks like to you. I could only muster the courage to watch the first season and couldn't bring myself to see the second. Whenever I listen to your favorite song which is also mine becuase my favourite singer is Lana Del Ray, "***Cinnamon Girl,***" it evokes your sense of humor, and I can't help but think about how amazing you are.

In light of this internal struggle, I have turned to my ***Tahajjud prayers,*** seeking guidance and assistance from Allah to navigate this situation. I spend approximately 20 out of 24 hours thinking about you, and I hope that seeking help from Allah will help me find clarity and peace in my thoughts and emotions.
