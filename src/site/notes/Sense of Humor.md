# Sense of Humor

If I were to briefly explain myself, I am a man who is very ***sensitive internally***. I can empathize with others and feel their emotions as if they were my own. Whenever I walk down the street and see someone, I always wonder how I can help them. For example, if I see a hawker, I wonder if they have earned enough for the day and if their children will have food in the evening. Sometimes, I even dedicate a portion of my income, around 20-40%, to charitable causes, and I have witnessed Allah's blessings and increased provision as a result.

I am a ***caring person***. When I encounter someone going through hardships, especially in terms of mental health issues like anxiety, depression, or heartbreak, I approach them with the intention of offering support. I let them know that they are not alone, that I am there to listen and guide them through their struggles.

I am also very **friendly**. Even if my friends tease or make jokes about me, I never show that I am offended. Throughout my life, I cannot recall anyone coming to me and apologizing for breaking our friendship. It is always me who takes the first step, even if the fault lies with the other person. I apologize to them and strive to restore harmony and maintain good relations.

>***I have never shared these aspects of myself with anyone before, but I am sharing them with you to convey that I am not a negative person, and I have trust on you just to show the real I am***

The last thing I want to emphasize is that *I am **not a materialistic person***. I don't judge others solely based on their beauty, intelligence, wealth, or fame. Instead, I assess individuals based on the goodness of their hearts, their sense of humor, and their adherence to Islamic values. I am fully aware that material possessions and external attributes fade away with time, but the qualities I mentioned earlier endure, even in the face of death. 

Therefore, I will not judge you based on your appearance, family background, or financial status. If you possess these things, I consider them blessings, but if you don't, it doesn't matter to me. What truly matters to me is the value of a person, not their possessions. I give importance to others' thoughts, qualities, personality, and the essence of who they are as individuals. So, please understand that I will not judge you based on superficial aspects like clothing or a luxurious lifestyle. In my heart, I always hold respect for others. 

I have a **fantastic sense of humo**r and enjoy engaging in playful activities. I find joy in doing childish things, playing physical and remote games, and even participating in silly antics that bring laughter to others. Exploring vast fields and immersing myself in nature is something I deeply appreciate. I also have a strong desire to travel the world with my partner, experiencing different cultures and creating unforgettable memories. My good sense of humor adds positivity and light-heartedness to my interactions with others, making moments more enjoyable and fostering a sense of connection.
