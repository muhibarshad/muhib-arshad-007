# How I Summoned the Strength 
## Take Action and opened up to stop this Hurtness.

After careful consideration, I realized that I couldn't continue avoiding the steps needed to heal my pain. It was necessary for me to confront the source of my suffering directly. That's why I made the decision to talk to you and share my thoughts and feelings. I approached this situation with a mindset of "***Do or Die,***" understanding the importance of taking action.

By now, you have learned a great deal about meâ€”my background, my thoughts about myself, and even things that only Allah Almighty and you are aware of. Additionally, you are mature and intelligent, and I believe you can grasp the reasons behind my decision to communicate with you. It's important to note that I didn't want to write this, but circumstances have greatly impacted me over the past six months. In February, the death of someone deeply important to me shattered me from within in a way that's difficult to comprehend. Subsequently, I experienced a series of losses, one after another. As a result, I reached a point where I couldn't bear any more pain, trauma, or hardships in my life. I didn't want to accumulate further suffering or face additional downfall and hardships.

***So I believe you will assist me in this situation, and whenever you have the time, please provide me with clear and honest feedback.***

**I kindly request** that you avoid giving responses that would further confuse me or leave me caught in the middle of two situations. If you are genuinely not interested in pursuing a with me or if your parents have different plans for you, please openly and freely communicate that to me. It won't be a problem for me, and I won't push for further continuation. I will make an effort to move on and forget everything, understanding that just as people eventually move on from the loss of loved ones and deaths, it takes time. However, if you are interested and believe I am suitable for you, please let me know as well. I simply want to progress on one side of the river, rather than lingering on the edge.

I believe it's sufficient to express myself in writing. Initially, I thought about calling you to convey my thoughts clearly, but then I considered your interest in reading and decided to write it all down for you. I trust that you will keep this conversation confidential, not sharing it with anyone or doing anything that would make me regret placing my trust in you. 

While it may seem like a common occurrence, please refrain from comparing me to other boys who are materialistic, simply engaging in shallow conversations and fleeting relationships. I am serious and straightforward, and I don't judge you based on your appearance or beauty. You might perceive me as constantly defending myself, but that's because our society has influenced our minds and shaped our thoughts in undesirable ways. Sometimes, I find myself questioning whether genuine and pure love still exists in this world, as everything seems to have become materialistic. I have even written a blog post on this topic, which you can read [here](https://medium.com/@muhibarshad101/friend-that-girl-is-so-beautiful-i-wish-she-could-be-my-spouse-83768b4c85dc).

>*I sincerely apologize for taking up your time, and I am truly grateful that you have read through all of this. I also hope that your response will help me move forward on one side of the river and not linger on the edge, hope you will reply to this, I will wait for your response.
