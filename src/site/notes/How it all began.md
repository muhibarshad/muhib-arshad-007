# How it all began


Before I proceed, I would like to share some information about my past and myself with you. I believe that understanding these details might help you interpret my thoughts and intentions accurately, without misjudgment.

>I*f you're not interested or don't have enough time to read about myself and my point of view, feel free to skip ahead to the remaining part. However, if you're willing to delve into it, I invite you to read about [[Myself and My POV\|Myself and My POV]]. Otherwise leave it and go ahead of the rest of the part.*

During my first semester, I wasn't even aware of your presence in the class. I didn't pay attention to any girls since I didn't know anyone. Some girls messaged me on my phone about programming questions, and I simply provided them with the answers without asking for their names or engaging in further conversation. However, in the second semester, I ***noticed you for the first time in the lab***. I saw you as the first girl done and leaving the difficult lab , and I was taken aback. Although I couldn't see you clearly, I managed to find out your name.
And first time I see you on the bus stop, Despite this, I didn't well on it much, and life carried on.

Then, during an English presentation, I heard your voice for the first time, and it caught my attention. I realized that you were different from other girls. ***Your voice is like i am hearing another world voice*** , and for several days, I found myself thinking about you. However, I hesitated due to the fear of jeopardizing my relationship with Allah and concerns about how 
>*you might perceive meâ€”whether you would think of me as cringe, a simp, or just like any other boy. So, I restrained myself and decided to wait for the right time to take any action, waiting until I felt ready to do so.*
  
During the third semester, everything seemed to be going well until a significant event occurred, one that I cannot share with you at this moment. Perhaps, in the future, when Allah Almighty wills it, I will disclose this trauma. Everything went downhill, and I struggled to stay strong. It felt as though I allowed my downfall to consume me.

As for my studies, I had been blessed with a good memory. In previous semesters, I would only study the day before exams and managed to achieve a CGPA of 3.5 in two semesters. However, in the third semester, I only studied for two hours before the exam in the morning, and as a result, my GPA dropped to 2.9. But let's move on from that.

Now move to the next chapter of why I message you ? [[Unmask the Mystery, Unlock the Truth of Messaging You!\|Unmask the Mystery, Unlock the Truth of Messaging You!]].
