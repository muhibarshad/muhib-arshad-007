# How it all began


Before I proceed, I would like to share some information about my past and myself with you. I believe that understanding these details might help you interpret my thoughts and intentions accurately, without misjudgment.

>If you're not interested or don't have enough time to read about myself and my point of view, feel free to skip ahead to the remaining part. However, if you're willing to delve into it, I invite you to read about [[Myself and My POV\|Myself and My POV]].

During my first semester, I wasn't even aware of your presence in the class. I didn't pay attention to any girls since I didn't know anyone. Some girls messaged me on my phone about programming questions, and I simply provided them with the answers without asking for their names or engaging in further conversation. However, in the second semester, I noticed you for the first time in the lab. I saw you as the first girl leaving the difficult lab , and I was taken aback. Although I couldn't see you clearly, I managed to find out your name.
And first time I see you on the bus stop, Despite this, I didn't well on it much, and life carried on.

Then, during an English presentation, I heard your voice for the first time, and it caught my attention. I realized that you were different from other girls. Your voice is like i am hearing another world voice , and for several days, I found myself thinking about you. However, I hesitated due to the fear of jeopardizing my relationship with Allah and concerns about how you might perceive me—whether you would think of me as cringe, a simp, or just like any other boy. So, I restrained myself and decided to wait for the right time to take any action, waiting until I felt ready to do so.
  
During the third semester, everything seemed to be going well until a significant event occurred, one that I cannot share with you at this moment. Perhaps, in the future, when Allah Almighty wills it, I will disclose this trauma. Everything went downhill, and I struggled to stay strong. It felt as though I allowed my downfall to consume me.

As for my studies, I had been blessed with a good memory. In previous semesters, I would only study the day before exams and managed to achieve a CGPA of 3.5 in two semesters. However, in the third semester, I only studied for two hours before the exam in the morning, and as a result, my GPA dropped to 2.9. But let's move on from that.

One day, while I was studying, I overheard some boys speaking disrespectfully about you. I won't mention their names, except for one individual, Ali Arslan, as his behavior was particularly unacceptable. It became apparent to me that you were a good girl who was unaware of their intentions, and I feared that society would influence you negatively. It was on that day that I made the decision to reach out to you and warn you about them, urging you to be cautious.

In that moment, I was filled with fear and uncertainty. I didn't know how you would react or if you would even reply to my message. Various thoughts raced through my mind, including the possibility of being misunderstood or judged. Nevertheless, with trembling hands, I mustered the courage to send you that message. I also send same message to Sania, knowing that both of you lived in the same hostel and shared the same bus stop, hoping that you could help me, even though I didn't actually require any assistance.

Just as I had opened our chat and contemplated how to approach the topic, a notification appeared on my screen. In my anxious state, I accidentally clicked on the video button, causing panic to well up within me. I held my breath as my mobile hung in mid-air, unsure of what to do next. Eventually, the video call ended abruptly, bringing a sense of relief. I assumed you were offline and hadn't noticed the mishap. However, to my surprise, you replied immediately. I struggled to find the right words to explain myself, apologizing and emphasizing that it was an accident and not intentional.

On every day I think, to message you about this, but leave this everyday, because on one side I really like you, and don't want to tell it you, and on the next side I want to tell you about this , and also tell about to be aware from others. But the fear of your thoughts, intention and everyday makes me to not do this. By the way I decided, I will talk little with you , revolve only around the topics and don't move away from the study topic. In my whole time there is no any hour I didn't thought about you. 

One thing I've noticed is that you always seem unhappy in class. I think you might be facing some trouble that's affecting your mood. I wanted to let you know that you don't have to be obsessed with anything. Recently, I've been making an effort to come to university regularly, showing you that I also have an interest in studies (laughing emoji). Actually, I wish I could meet you in person and discuss all of this face to face, but I haven't found the time, and I also wonder what you think.

From the very first day, I made the decision to always communicate with you in person because sometimes messages can't accurately convey what we truly mean, leading to confusion. It's only when we experience things in reality that we realize they're not what we expected.

By the way, I really appreciate it when you send notes with numbers. It makes me feel good, even though I don't actually need them. It's one of the things you do as part of your main tasks, and I genuinely like it. I started thinking that I wouldn't have to message you again because I don't believe I'm good or capable of messaging. For a while, I refrained from messaging you. However, one day I realized that maybe you weren't aware of the Laptop Scheme, so I informed you about it.

I always assumed that I should only message you about tasks when you didn't ask for any help, even though I really want to assist you. Then I noticed that you are online around 12:00 PM, 2:30 PM, 8:00 PM, and even late at night around 2:00 AM. So I started messaging you only during these times.

One day, while browsing the suggestion section, I came across your Instagram account and decided to add you. On my social media, I only add people whom I trust, and out of the entire PUCIT, I chose to send a request only to you. My friend list consists mainly of family members, close friends from school, college, and FAST University.

However, when you didn't accept my request, I understood that there might be privacy concerns or other reasons for not accepting it. I didn't think that you had ignored me. I found myself checking 20-25 times a day to see if you had accepted my request. I even memorized the number of your posts, followers, and people you were following. Initially, you had around 40 posts, 30+ followers, and were following 725 accounts. Over time, I noticed your following count gradually increased to 754. Then, suddenly, I observed a decrease in your posts and followers, with posts going down to 30 and followers to 24. I have also the 24 followers and I make a decison as myself the 25 follower may be the you or not any. However, your following count remained relatively unchanged. Recently, I noticed that even your following count has decreased to 654. And yesterday I see your follower increase to 25 , and following from yesterday starts to increase.

On Eid day, during the night, you changed your display picture, and I saw it. It looked really good, simple, and aesthetically pleasing, unlike some cringe-worthy photos of other girls.

I even stalked you on Snapchat, GitHub, and Facebook, but I couldn't find your Facebook account. On the day of Arafah, when we talked, I felt good when you mentioned that you were also fasting. Through your statuses, I realized that you are also devoted to your faith. Additionally, your thoughtful messaging style made me realize that you are not like other girls who might be cringe-worthy. You come across as a shy, sensitive, and not-too-talkative person. I also understood this from your status that said, "I have specialized in the fine arts of self-sabotage."

I consider myself a deep thinker, therapist, and someone with the ability to understand other people, thanks to the blessings of Allah. However, when it comes to understanding you, it has become quite challenging for me. That's when I decided to gather some information about your hobbies and sense of humor. I created a sense of humor test form and waited for the right moment to send it to you.

I never wanted to sever our connection and always looked for ways to strengthen it. I patiently waited, hoping that you would initiate a conversation. At the same time, I thought that perhaps you were too shy to message me, so I tried to find various resources to engage with you, such as discussing statuses or providing information about the laptop scheme.

In our messages, I always expressed the sentiment, "If I'm going wrong, please let me know," because I genuinely wanted to understand your thoughts about me. Regarding your "Mehmood Darwiash" status, I didn't see it right away because I was out with my friends on a picnic at the lake that day, and I enjoyed myself a lot. I only checked my phone at night and came across your status then. I felt as though you ignored me, but in reality, I didn't ignore you. Later that night, I put up a status hoping that you would realize I was with my friends. However, even after 24 hours and the following week, you didn't see any of my statuses. At that point, I thought you were seeking revenge, but I chose to ignore it.

I've always wanted to hear your voice, but I refrained from explicitly mentioning it because I didn't want to come across as too forward or cringe-worthy. So instead, I simply told you that your voice is really good and that I like it.

Then I came up with an idea—I thought maybe we could learn together on Google Meet, where I could listen to your voice. I made a complete study plan and hoped that you would accept it. I genuinely wanted to help you with your learning, particularly in web development and Git, as I believe they are essential skills.

Suddenly, I began noticing that you were ignoring me from the beginning, but I didn't pay much attention to it (feeling hurt). I observed that whenever I messaged you, you would reply very late, often with just one or two words. This confusion turned intoharsh a  reality when I messaged you and you didn't even reply to my greeting for the entire day. So I would message you again to remind you to reply. Maybe you were busy, but taking 10-20 seconds to respond wouldn't disrupt your life significantly. Then you mentioned that you weren't interested in my study plan, to which I replied, "It's okay." However, the truth is, I am currently going through a tough time, and I was hoping for someone who would support me and help me rebuild. I thought you might be that person, someone with whom I could learn consistently. But when you rejected my offer, it hurt me deeply, and I still haven't learned a single word. Insha'Allah, I will overcome my situation and start everything anew.

One day, I shared 5-6 memes about the thread, and you only saw the first one without acknowledging the others. It clearly indicated that you ignored me, just as you would see other people's statuses but move on when mine appeared. Furthermore, whenever I messaged you, you would ignore me to a great extent.

Then I start realizing that you are irritating from me, and you actually don't want to talk with me. Then I accept this harsh reality, And decided not to message you again , because it is as you wish. But on everyday I think a lot about you more than before and one day I think I have to get your hobbies as well, so I messaged you about the laptop scheme and then you also ignore me, then by sacrificing my self-respect, I message you and talk with you by accepting the fact that in actually you are not interested in me . 

When you mentioned that you wanted to live in Forks, I pondered over it and thought about how you could achieve that goal. Through my research, I realized that contributing to open source projects and working remotely with companies could potentially help you fulfill that dream. I genuinely want to see you happy, something I haven't witnessed yet.

During the sense of humor test, I discovered that you are an amazing person with a similar sense of humor to mine. I really enjoy football, and it seems that your music taste aligns with mine as well. Lana Del Rey happens to be my favorite singer too, and her voice is truly amazing. I also have a strong desire to watch series. The main difference between you and me is that you actually engage in these activities, while I want to do them but struggle to find the time. Currently, I have a part-time job, and my days are occupied with construction work at another property. However, even with my busy schedule, whenever you message me, I make it a point to reply to everyone because I understand how it feels to be ignored.

On that particular night, you didn't reply to my last messages, and I accepted that. When you eventually replied, you mentioned that you were busy and going somewhere, promising to discuss it when you were free. However, you didn't respond afterwards, so I decided to address the matter myself, thinking that maybe you would take the initiative. But once again, you ignored me and replied after a long period of time. I didn't expect an immediate response, but if you had seen the message, a simple acknowledgment would have sufficed, stating that you would reply when you had the time. It's just a matter of not making another person wait for an extended period and causing unnecessary distress. This is just friendly advice because a good friend is someone who points out your mistakes, not someone who constantly praises you.

Furthermore, I wanted to assist you with your learning. I simply wanted to review your code and provide suggestions for improvement. However, you mentioned that you were in Lahore and would send the code when you returned home, and I'm still waiting for it. I never showed you that these things bothered me; I simply let them go. But then I realized that you started ignoring me to a significant extent, even going so far as to hide me from your statuses. In an effort to see you happy, I shared information about the laptop scheme with you. When I saw the list, I first searched for your name and then mine.

But then you replied one of my status  , I send you a message , you just react to it and ignored.

On that day, I reflected on our interactions from the beginning, and I realized that you never initiated conversations with me. Despite sacrificing my self-respect and messaging you first, you consistently ignored my messages. Sometimes, it would take an entire day for you to reply to a single message, while other times you would ignore one message and respond to another later. It was during this time that I recalled a particular status of yours that still lingers in my mind.

I couldn't comprehend why you were behaving this way, as I didn't fully understand the thought processes of girls. Therefore, I decided to discuss this issue with my sister, who has a brilliant mind and tends to contemplate things more deeply than I do. She told me, "Muhib, actually, all girls are similar to her. Initially, they may listen to you, but once they realize they have over-shared or revealed too much, they will start ignoring you. They are not interested in continuing the conversation or engaging further, so you don't text her again and don't disturb her, because she will never tell you about this she is irritating from you." 

But I am not satisfied with her response. I discussed the same issue with a friend of mine who has been teaching me all my Islamic teachings for the past 10 years. He provided a different perspective, saying, 'Whenever a girl already has someone in her life, they may not feel comfortable talking to other people.'

After considering both responses, I realized that these viewpoints are not necessarily negative but rather reflect individual rights, priorities, and perspectives. It's important for me to respect other people's points of view, their priorities, and what they think. I have never compelled or forced anyone to do something against their will, and I will continue to maintain that approach. I will never said to you why you do this, why you are doing , because I have always respect for you. 

After these discussions and gaining different perspectives, I found myself unconsciously thinking about you more than before. I constantly wondered why you were behaving in the way you were and engaging in these actions. It left me with a sense of confusion. I questioned what you truly thought about me, whether you were interested in me like I was interested in you, and if you desired to continue our connection or not.

You don't know how much these thoughts have affected my sleep at night. I find myself unable to rest, constantly feeling like something is missing in my life. I can't help but think about you all the time, even though I don't understand why. In my eyes, you are the perfect girl I have ever come across. You possess intelligence, purity, faithfulness, goodness, strength, and the ability to understand things. You are also sensitive, crazy, and funny, just like me. You seem to embody everything I could ever desire in a person.

However, I find myself torn between your peculiar behavior and the way you captivate my heart and mind. It feels as though I'm trapped in between, neither fully on stable ground nor fully immersed in uncertain waters. There is a series I watched called "The End of the Fucking World," where the girl have same hair style to you. I could only muster the courage to watch the first season and couldn't bring myself to see the second. Whenever I listen to our favorite song, "Cinnamon Girl," it evokes your sense of humor, and I can't help but think about how amazing you are.

In light of this internal struggle, I have turned to my tahajjud prayers, seeking guidance and assistance from Allah to navigate this situation. I spend approximately 20 out of 24 hours thinking about you, and I hope that seeking help from Allah will help me find clarity and peace in my thoughts and emotions.

After careful consideration, I realized that I couldn't continue avoiding the steps needed to heal my pain. It was necessary for me to confront the source of my suffering directly. That's why I made the decision to talk to you and share my thoughts and feelings. I approached this situation with a mindset of "Do or Die," understanding the importance of taking action.

By now, you have learned a great deal about me—my background, my thoughts about myself, and even things that only Allah Almighty and you are aware of. Additionally, you are mature and intelligent, and I believe you can grasp the reasons behind my decision to communicate with you. It's important to note that I didn't want to write this, but circumstances have greatly impacted me over the past six months. In February, the death of someone deeply important to me shattered me from within in a way that's difficult to comprehend. Subsequently, I experienced a series of losses, one after another. As a result, I reached a point where I couldn't bear any more pain, trauma, or hardships in my life. I didn't want to accumulate further suffering or face additional downfall and hardships.

So I believe you will assist me in this situation, and whenever you have the time, please provide me with clear and honest feedback. I kindly request that you avoid giving responses that would further confuse me or leave me caught in the middle of two situations. If you are genuinely not interested in pursuing a with me or if your parents have different plans for you, please openly and freely communicate that to me. It won't be a problem for me, and I won't push for further continuation. I will make an effort to move on and forget everything, understanding that just as people eventually move on from the loss of loved ones, it takes time. However, if you are interested and believe I am suitable for you, please let me know as well. I simply want to progress on one side of the river, rather than lingering on the edge.

I believe it's sufficient to express myself in writing. Initially, I thought about calling you to convey my thoughts clearly, but then I considered your interest in reading and decided to write it all down for you. I trust that you will keep this conversation confidential, not sharing it with anyone or doing anything that would make me regret placing my trust in you. I sincerely apologize for taking up your time, and I am truly grateful that you have read through all of this. I also hope that your response will help me move forward on one side of the river and not linger on the edge.

While it may seem like a common occurrence, please refrain from comparing me to other boys who are materialistic, simply engaging in shallow conversations and fleeting relationships. I am serious and straightforward, and I don't judge you based on your appearance or beauty. You might perceive me as constantly defending myself, but that's because our society has influenced our minds and shaped our thoughts in undesirable ways. Sometimes, I find myself questioning whether genuine and pure love still exists in this world, as everything seems to have become materialistic. I have even written a blog post on this topic, which you can read [here](https://medium.com/@muhibarshad101/friend-that-girl-is-so-beautiful-i-wish-she-could-be-my-spouse-83768b4c85dc).
