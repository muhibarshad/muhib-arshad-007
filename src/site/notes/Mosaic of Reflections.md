# A Journey Within

## "A short novel that you may consider reading while traveling on a train through vast fields."

**Firstly**, I didn't know how to write all of these in English because I am not proficient in the language, but I will do my best to express myself. Additionally, English is not well-suited for conveying emotions effectively.

**Secondly**, I initially had no intention of writing this, but a strong urge compelled me to do so. If I didn't write all of this today, it might become a lifelong regret for me. However, I believe that as human beings, we tend to forget things over time, just as we forget our childhood memories. Perhaps it will heal in the future, similar to other diseases, but for now, I view this writing as a temporary relief, like taking an antibiotic.

>If reading this bores or frustrates you, I kindly request that you consider it a marked assignment and still read it. Additionally, everyone has the right to express their point of view.

**Lastly**, I kindly request that you do not think negatively of me. I am not attempting to convince you, cause any trouble, force you, or be like others. I am simply expressing myself, sharing my current situation, and presenting my thoughts and point of view to you. All I ask in return is your ***feedback*** â€“ an honest response that reflects your true thoughts and opinions. Please be open and straightforward in providing your feedback, as I do not wish to create further confusion or additional problems. I sincerely request your cooperation in this matter.

So, I didn't know where to began, but the word "began" itself gives me a clue to begin with the story of [[How it all began\|How it all began]].
