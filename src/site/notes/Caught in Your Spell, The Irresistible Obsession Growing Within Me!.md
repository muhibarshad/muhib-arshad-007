# Caught in Your Spell: The Irresistible Obsession Growing Within Me!

*From the very first day, I made the decision to always communicate with you in person because sometimes messages can't accurately convey what we truly mean, leading to confusion. It's only when we experience things in reality that we realize they're not what we expected.*

By the way, ***I really appreciate it when you send notes with numbers.*** It makes me feel good, even though I don't actually need them. It's one of the things you do as part of your main tasks, and I genuinely like it. I started thinking that I wouldn't have to message you again because I don't believe I'm good or capable of messaging. For a while, I refrained from messaging you. However, one day I realized that maybe you weren't aware of the Laptop Scheme, so I informed you about it.

I always assumed that I should only message you about tasks when you didn't ask for any help, even though I really want to assist you. Then I noticed that you are online around 12:00 PM, 2:30 PM, 8:00 PM, and even late at night around 2:00 AM. So I started messaging you only during these times.

One day, while browsing the suggestion section, I came across your Instagram account and decided to add you. 
>On my social media, I only add people whom I trust, and out of the entire ***PUCIT***, I chose to send a request only to you. My friend list consists mainly of family members, close friends from school, college, and ***FAST*** University.

However, when you didn't accept my request, I understood that there might be privacy concerns or other reasons for not accepting it. I didn't think that you had ignored me. I found myself checking 20-25 times a day to see if you had accepted my request. I even memorized the number of your posts, followers, and people you were following. Initially, you had around 40 posts, 30+ followers, and were following 725 accounts. Over time, I noticed your following count gradually increased to 754. Then, suddenly, I observed a decrease in your posts and followers, with posts going down to 30 and followers to 24. I have also the 24 followers and I make a decision as myself the 25 follower may be the you or not any. However, your following count remained relatively unchanged. Recently, I noticed that even your following count has decreased to 654. And yesterday I see your follower increase to 25 , and following to 658 from yesterday.(date : 17th July , 2023 )

***On Eid day***, during the night, you changed your display picture, and I saw it. It looked really good, simple, and aesthetically pleasing, unlike some cringe-worthy photos of other girls.

I even stalked you on ***Snapchat, GitHub, and Facebook***, but I couldn't find your Facebook account. On the day of Arafah, when we talked, I felt good when you mentioned that you were also fasting. Through your statuses, I realized that you are also devoted to your faith. Additionally, your thoughtful messaging style made me realize that you are not like other girls who might be cringe-worthy. You come across as a shy, sensitive, and not-too-talkative person. I also understood this from your status that said, 

>***"I have specialized in the fine arts of self-sabotage."***

I consider myself a deep thinker, therapist, and someone with the ability to understand other people, thanks to the blessings of Allah. However, when it comes to understanding you, it has become quite challenging for me. That's when I decided to gather some information about your hobbies and sense of humor. I created a sense of humor test form and waited for the right moment to send it to you.

I never wanted to sever our connection and always looked for ways to strengthen it. I patiently waited, hoping that you would initiate a conversation. At the same time, I thought that perhaps you were too shy to message me, so I tried to find various resources to engage with you, such as discussing statuses or providing information about the laptop scheme.

In our messages, I always expressed the sentiment,

*"If I'm going wrong, please let me know,"*

Because I genuinely wanted to understand your thoughts about me. Regarding your "***Mehmood Darwiash***" status, I didn't see it right away because I was out with my friends on a picnic at the lake that day, and I enjoyed myself a lot. I only checked my phone at night and came across your status then. I felt as though you ignored me, but in reality, I didn't ignore you. Later that night, I put up a status hoping that you would realize I was with my friends. However, even after 24 hours and the following week, you didn't see any of my statuses. At that point, I thought you were seeking revenge, but I chose to ignore and accept it.

>*I've always wanted to hear your voice, but I refrained from explicitly mentioning it because I didn't want to come across as too forward or cringe-worthy. So instead, I simply told you that your voice is really good and that I like it.*
