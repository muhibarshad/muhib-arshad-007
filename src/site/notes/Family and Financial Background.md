# Family and Financial Background

From my family's side, I have two siblings. My sister is employed in a government city school and also doing mphill, and my brother is currently pursuing his FSC (intermediate level of education). My father works as a Line Superintendent in MEPCO (Multan Electric Power Company), while my mother engages in embroidery work known as Gotta Kinari at home.

In terms of extended family, our relatives are limited. I have only one paternal uncle (chachu) and one paternal aunt (kahla). We do not have any mamu and phuphoo Allah na dy hi nai , (crying emoji ) and so paternal or maternal grandparents are died. My chachu works as a clerk in Quaid-e-Azam University in Islamabad, and my khala is a housewife residing in Multan.

I reside in Kabirwala, a small city near Khanewal. In my opinion, my city is the best I have ever seen because it offers everything I need.

Since my childhood, my parents have experienced conflicts, which led them to live separately. We have accepted this situation as it is and continued to respect and support them. While they have always been cautious and caring towards us, they did not provide the level of affection we desired during our childhood.

In terms of financial conditions, I come from a middle-class family. We may not belong to the elite or be exceptionally wealthy, but we have all the necessary things in life. We have extra houses, some agricultural land, plots of land, and a good home where I currently reside. We have access to good clothing and quality food. Overall, our financial situation is comfortable within the middle-class spectrum.

This is sufficient, I believe. At this point, you have gained an understanding of who I am. Discussing my past and how I lived my earlier life would require another chapter. Perhaps we can explore it another day, covering topics such as self-development, childhood experiences, influential individuals, and hobbies. However, I don't consider this information vital. What truly matters is conveying my current situation and presenting my authentic self to you.I have written a short brief not on my past you can checkout it here [[Why people called me 007?\|Why people called me 007?]].
