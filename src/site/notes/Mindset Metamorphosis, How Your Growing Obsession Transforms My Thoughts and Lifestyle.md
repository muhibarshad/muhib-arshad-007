# Mindset Metamorphosis
## How Your Growing Obsession Transforms My Thoughts and Lifestyle

When you mentioned that you wanted to live in **Forks**, I pondered over it and thought about how you could achieve that goal. Through my research, I realized that contributing to open source projects and working remotely with companies could potentially help you fulfill that dream. I genuinely want to see you happy, something I haven't witnessed yet.

During the sense of humor test, I discovered that you are an amazing person with a similar sense of humor to mine. I really enjoy football, and it seems that your music taste aligns with mine as well. Lana Del Rey happens to be my favorite singer too, and her voice is truly amazing. I also have a strong desire to watch series, animes and movies, just not Kdramas i don't like korean boys like BTS (laughing emoji). The main difference between you and me is that you actually engage in these activities, while I want to do them but struggle to find the time. Currently, I have a part-time work, and my days are occupied with at home doing some work and sleep. However, even with my busy schedule and at work because its timing is 7-12 , *whenever you message me, I make it a point to reply to everyone because I understand how it feels to be ignored.*

***On that particular night,*** you didn't reply to my last messages, and I accepted that. When you eventually replied, you mentioned that you were busy and going somewhere, promising to discuss it when you were free. However, you didn't respond afterwards, so I decided to address the matter myself, thinking that maybe you would take the initiative. But once again, you ignored me and replied after a long period of time. I didn't expect an immediate response, but if you had seen the message, a simple acknowledgment would have sufficed, stating that you would reply when you had the time. It's just a matter of not making another person wait for an extended period and causing unnecessary distress. This is just friendly advice because a good friend is someone who points out your mistakes, not someone who constantly praises you.

Furthermore, I wanted to assist you with your learning. I simply wanted to review your code and provide suggestions for improvement. However, you mentioned that you were in Lahore and would send the code when you returned home, and I'm still waiting for it. I never showed you that these things bothered me; I simply let them go. But then I realized that you started ignoring me to a significant extent, even going so far as to hide me from your statuses. In an effort to see you happy, I shared information about the laptop scheme with you. When I saw the list, I first searched for your name and then mine.

***But then you replied one of my status  , I send you a message , you just react to it and ignored.***
