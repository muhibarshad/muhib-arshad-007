# Bad Habits

Now, if I were to mention my bad habits, I must admit that I lack consistency in various aspects of life. For example, I may study diligently for two weeks and then take a two-week break. I have a tendency to alternate between intense periods of productivity and days where I simply sleep all day. When I asked my siblings about this, they referred to me as ***idle***. Additionally, I struggle with ***impatience***. I prefer to rush through tasks and have little tolerance for waiting. I am also not good in sports " Phly bol pa out".

One major problem in my life is that I tend to trust people too quickly. I believe that others will never betray my trust, leading me to share my deepest secrets with them. Unfortunately, I often realize later that this was a mistake.

Bitter reality is also that , I am not good in looking like other z-generation boys, I am not handsome yo boy, But I don't care , because Allah has made, And he is the best Artist. I am very grateful to HIM.

I have some personal challenges, including overthinking, emotional attachments, living in a virtual world, and creating imaginary scenarios before sleep. These factors contribute to sleep problems. Furthermore, my confidence level is quite low, and I struggle with assertiveness. I don't know how to stand up for myself without hurting others.

I also feel uncomfortable in social gatherings, and the fear of being judged by society often hinders me. I am actively working on overcoming these issues, particularly by addressing my tendency to overthink and focusing on building my self-confidence.iew
